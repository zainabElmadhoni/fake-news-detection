Social Media Analysis for the Detection of Fake news concerning Corona Virus

With the increasing popularity of social media and web-based forums, the distribution of fake news has become a major threat to various sectors and agencies. This has abated trust 
in the media, leaving readers in a state of perplexity. There exists an enormous assemblage of research on the theme of Artificial Intelligence (AI) strategies for fake news detection. 
In the past, much of the focus has been given on classifying online reviews and freely accessible online social networking-based posts.

The objective of this project was to find the best classifier that can predict whether a piece of news concerning corona virus is fake based only on its content, thereby
approaching the problem from a purely NLP perspective. An important part of the goal was to compare and report the results from multiple different model implementations, 
and present an analysis of the findings.
